# Geometry-Detection-Tool_ACAD
In this Folder, there are visual lisp programs which detect geometries using only their values such as length, area etc., for each geometric shape in ACAD without any layer or color information.
1. These visual lisp programs are used to detect similar with tolerances when a pdf is exported into ACAD with no layer infromation.
2. You can use these lisp programs to detect and select similar geometries and add them to a specific layer.
3. There are also Dynamo scripts which can help to place families based on ACAD layer information created.
